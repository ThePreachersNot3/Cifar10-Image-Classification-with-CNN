# Cifar10-Image-Classification-with-CNN
There are different techniques to do an image classification. The Convolutional Neural Network was used here, with the goal of creating a model that extract specific features and predicts what an image is.

Note - all these happen behind the scene.

#**DATASET**

The CIFAR-10 dataset from tensorflow.keras consists of 60000 32x32 colour images with 10 classes['airplane','automobile','bird','cat','deer','dog','frog','horse','ship','truck'], 6000 images per class.
There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images
